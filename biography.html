                    <p>
                        He began acting on television, guest-starring in <em>Boston Common</em> and joined <em>Saturday Night Live</em> as a writer but

                    <p>
                        In August <time datetime="2012">2012</time>, Galifianakis married <em>Quinn Lundberg</em>, co-founder of the <em>Growing Voices</em> charity, at the
                        <em>UBC Farm</em> in Vancouver, British Columbia. On September 7, <time datetime="2013">2013</time>, Lundberg gave birth to their first child,
                        a boy, and Galifianakis missed the premiere of his film <em>Are You Here</em> to attend the birth. He had a
                        second child in November <time datetime="2016">2016</time>.
                        Lundberg's cousin, <em>Charlie Clark</em>, is the mayor of <em>Saskatoon, Saskatchewan</em>. On the day of the election,
                        Galifianakis made a video endorsing Clark's campaign.
                        In January <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, Galifianakis and <em>A Night of a Thousand Vaginas</em> co-star <em>Sarah Silverman</em> announced their
                        intention to raise $20,000 to help fund the <em>Texas Abortion Fund</em>, part of a nationwide network of funds set
                        up to assist women in obtaining abortions in states whose legislatures had placed restrictions on the practice.
                        The fundraiser was set up in response to the passage of Texas H.B. 2, which established several restrictions
                        that forced a majority of the state's abortion clinics to close.
                        Galifianakis owns a farm in northeastern Alleghany County, North Carolina, and splits his time between
                        the farm and his work. He said, <em>"My farm is a place that I get to think clearly and pretend to know what I am doing."</em>
                        Galifianakis befriended an octogenarian homeless woman who was living in a Santa Monica laundromat for 18 years.
                        Galifianakis got her an apartment across the street from the laundromat. The story was revealed in the <time datetime="2015">2015</time>
                        documentary <em>Queen Mimi</em>.
